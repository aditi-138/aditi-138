## Introduction

Chest cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and accurate classification of cancerous lesions can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project aims to develop a deep learning model to classify chest cancer from medical images, particularly using techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Features
- Preprocessing of medical images
- Custom CNN architecture for chest cancer classification
- Evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualization of training results (loss/accuracy curves)
- Model testing on new images

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of labeled chest cancer images. For this project, we used publicly available datasets such as:
- [ChestX-ray8 Dataset](https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC)
- Custom medical images sourced from various online databases

Please make sure to download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory before proceeding.

## Installation

To run this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
